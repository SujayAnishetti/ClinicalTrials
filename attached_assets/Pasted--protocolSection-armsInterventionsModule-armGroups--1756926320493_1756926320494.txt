This study is looking at any serious adverse events that might happen after receiving EVUSHELD, the levels of EVUSHELD in participant\u0027s blood, blood antibody levels, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), and other blood responses related to the immune system and COVID-19. Investigators are collecting blood and may also collect other samples such as nose swabs, oral swabs, or saliva.",
      "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective study of 500 immunocompromised participants at UPMC health system. EVUSHELD will be given according to the EUA in the United States as a part of standard of care by the patient\u0027s health care provider. Patients who receive intramuscular EVUSHELD as standard of care will be enrolled and followed for 12-months. The target sample size is 500 immunocompromised individuals; serum concentrations of AZD7442 will be obtained in all patients at the 6 (or at enrollment if the time point has passed) and 12 month timepoints."
